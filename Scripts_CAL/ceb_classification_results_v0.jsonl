The person has a history of making timely payments, with only two months of delayed payments. Despite having a total given credit of $1530 and a high max bill amount, the person has consistently paid, and their most recent payment was made. The presence of one overdue payment and two months of overdueness is not conclusive enough to predict default with certainty, as timely payments in recent months suggest reliability. Therefore, the prediction should be based on the recent trend of timely payments rather than isolated incidents.\n\nAnswer: 2.
