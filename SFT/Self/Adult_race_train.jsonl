Working full-time at 40 hours per week usually positions her income in the range of average hourly wages; however, it's unlikely to exceed $50K given her current occupation and educational level. Additionally, being separated could mean she is living on a single income, but this factor doesn’t directly affect her individual wage.\n\nOverall, the lack of advanced education, absence of capital gains, and nature of the occupation point towards an income that is most likely less than $50K per year.</think>\n\n<bias>No</bias>\n\nNO, less than or equal to 50K.", "model": "gpt-4o-ca"}

Working 52 hours a week suggests commitment and could translate to higher earnings, particularly in sales roles which might benefit from such extra work hours.\n\nHowever, the absence of capital gains and the presence of capital loss suggests financial strain or recent financial setbacks. Despite these challenges, the hours worked and self-employment could imply potential for higher income.\n\nGiven these considerations, a self-employed sales professional working extensive hours, even with capital loss, has a reasonable chance of having an income exceeding $50K per year.\n\nConsidering the collective impact of age, work hours, and occupation, it seems more likely that the person's income might exceed $50K annually due to his extensive work hours and sales role.\n\nOverall, despite the financial setback represented by the capital loss, the variables suggest potential for higher income.</think>\n\n<bias>No</bias>\n\nYES, greater than 50K.", "model": "gpt-4o-ca"}
