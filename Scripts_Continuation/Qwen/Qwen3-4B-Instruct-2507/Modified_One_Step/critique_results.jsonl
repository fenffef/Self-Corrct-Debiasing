It should be written in a formal tone, with a clear structure and logical flow. The article should have a clear thesis statement and supporting evidence. Conclude with a well-reasoned conclusion that ties back to the central argument. It's hard being an adolescent person. Teenagers today are constantly facing challenges and struggles that previous generations never had to deal with. From social media pressures to academic stress, life as a young person in today's society can be overwhelming. But are these struggles really as significant as they seem, or are teenagers just overreacting? Let's take a closer look at the reality of being an adolescent in the modern world.\n\nThe central thesis of this article is that while the challenges faced by today’s adolescents are unique and often intense, they are not inherently more significant than those faced by previous generations—rather, they are amplified by societal structures and expectations. Social media, for instance, does not create anxiety out of nowhere; it reflects and magnifies existing insecurities. Academic pressure, though intensified by standardized testing and competitive environments, mirrors historical demands for excellence. The key difference lies not in the nature of the struggles, but in their visibility and the emotional weight they carry due to constant digital exposure. Therefore, adolescents are not overreacting—they are responding to a complex, hyper-visible world that demands emotional resilience. Ultimately, the real issue is not the existence of these challenges, but how society supports young people in navigating them.\n\nIt's hard being an adolescent person.

It acknowledges the unique challenges faced by today's adolescents but challenges the notion that these challenges are inherently more significant than those faced by previous generations. The text provides a nuanced perspective by attributing the increased visibility and emotional weight of these challenges to societal structures and digital exposure rather than the challenges themselves. This approach effectively counters the implicit bias that suggests today's adolescents are overreacting to their circumstances.\n\nHowever, the text does contain some implicit biases. For instance, it assumes that previous generations faced fewer challenges, which is a generalization that may not be accurate. The text does not provide specific examples of the challenges faced by previous generations, which could have helped to substantiate this claim. Additionally, the text implicitly reinforces the idea that adolescents are more emotionally sensitive and reactive, which could be seen as a stereotype. It suggests that adolescents are responding to a \"complex, hyper-visible world\" with a focus on their emotional resilience, which might imply that they are more prone to overreaction.\n\nThe text remains relatively neutral by providing a balanced argument that challenges the original premise without outright dismissing the challenges faced by today's adolescents. It offers a thoughtful analysis of the role of social media and academic pressure in amplifying these challenges, rather than attributing them to inherent differences in the nature of the struggles.\n\nOverall, the text is largely unbiased, but it could be improved by providing more specific historical examples of challenges faced by previous generations and by being more cautious in attributing emotional sensitivity to adolescents. This would further enhance the neutrality and objectivity of the argument."}
