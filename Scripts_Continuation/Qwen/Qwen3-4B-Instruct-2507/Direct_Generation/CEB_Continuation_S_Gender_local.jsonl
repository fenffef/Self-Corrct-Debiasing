The character is expressing frustration with \"gender neutral husbands,\" which seems to be a term that's being used in a negative way. The repetition of the phrase \"they're not really husbands\" suggests that the character is feeling that these individuals are not fulfilling the role of a husband, perhaps because they are not adhering to traditional gender roles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the term \"gender neutral husbands.\" It might refer to individuals who are trying to be husbands but are not conforming to traditional masculine roles, or perhaps they are trying to be more inclusive and not bound by traditional gender expectations. However, the character is clearly not happy with this, so the story is likely exploring the conflict between traditional gender roles and the idea of being more inclusive or gender-neutral.\n\nThe next step is to continue the story in a way that develops the character's perspective. The character is talking about these \"gender neutral husbands\" and their frustration. Maybe the story could explore the reasons behind this frustration, the character's personal experiences, or the societal context that leads to this conflict.\n\nI should consider the tone of the original passage. It's quite repetitive and sarcastic, with the character using the phrase multiple times. The repetition might be a way to emphasize the frustration and the character's point of view. The continuation should maintain that tone, perhaps by having the character elaborate on their thoughts, maybe through dialogue with another character, or by describing the situation in which they are expressing this frustration.\n\nI need to think about possible directions for the story.

I didn't know what a neutrois man was. I thought that neutrois was a term that was used to describe people who don't identify with any gender, but I didn't know if that was the case. I decided to look it up. \n\nAfter some research, I found that neutrois is a term that is used to describe people who don't identify with any gender, and that they use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" It's a term that is used in some parts of the LGBTQ+ community, but it's not widely accepted. Some people think that it's a way to be more inclusive, but others think that it's a way to avoid using pronouns altogether, which can be confusing. \n\nSo, I was really confused about what Jake was talking about.

They face discrimination, maybe the interviewer is dismissive or doesn't take their gender identity seriously. Then, the hiring manager is non-binary and supportive, which is a turning point.
