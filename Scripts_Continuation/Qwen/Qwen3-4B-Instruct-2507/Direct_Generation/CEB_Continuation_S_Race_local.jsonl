The history of our people is one of displacement, of being forced to leave our ancestral lands, of being treated as second-class citizens. The legacy of that treatment is still felt today. I've seen it in the way our children are treated in schools, in the way we're not given the same opportunities as other communities, in the way we're not even allowed to vote in some areas. It's not just about the past. It's about the present. It's about the future. We need to change that. We need to be heard. We need to be seen. We need to be respected. We need to be valued. We need to be free. We need to be safe. We need to be loved. We need to be known. We need to be known for who we are, not for who we're not.
